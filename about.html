            <p>Hi! My name is Tyler Bernard</p>
            <p>
                I am currently enrolled at James Madison University and I am expected
                to graduate in December 2025. I started my college career in 2019 where
                I went to Germanna Community College to work on my Psychology degree. I 
                graduated with my Associate's degree in Psychology in 2021. When I got my 
                Associate's degree I no longer wanted to continue with Psychology, so I took
                a year off of school to figure out what I wanted to do. I eventually decided I wanted
                to pursue my Computer Science degree in May of 2022. I am now currently working towards
                my Bachelor's degree and I am expected to graduate in December 2025.
            </p>
